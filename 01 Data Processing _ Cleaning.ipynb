It is about 11 gallons.  I'm watching all these poor souls trying to leave South Florida in a storm not knowing where they will get gas Im thinking why didnt they buy a hybrid!!!  Maybe they will learn someday.  I have had it over 2 years  and it performs well. Not a huge amount of power like some gas cars but far more than enough for my needs and it can pass fairly well too.   Runs so quiet I sometimes try to leave it when its still running!  If I do an alarm will sound.  It has handles that light up door handle when I approach. Lights that go on when it gets dark, and lots more. I have the LX model.  I bought it from a dealer who offered the 20 year 200,000 warranty. Most offer  10 year.  Read any warranty papers very carefully and make sure you keep up your maintenance or the warranty is void. It takes full synthetic oil. I am taking it to KIA dealers to make sure records are proper. Shop around. I have found different KIA dealers vary A LOT S as far as maintenance prices.  My 2017 came with a can of sealer rather than a spare tire. I didnt want any part of that so made a purchase offer with the tire kit added. Then though you loose cargo space but Im not willing to trust a little can of fix a flat to save me.   It comes with satellite radio.  Free for a few months then you have to subscribe. If you keep saying NO they will drop the price.  The KIA books that comes with the car take up the whole glovebox!  There is more space in the console. Im starting to get seat wear in drivers seat after 11 months. Not bad but noticeable.  So I put a seat cover over the drivers seat to save wear on the seat. Im heavier than average so if your not lets hope your fabric lasts longer.  Had engine warning coming on after fill up a lot, a change of gas cap fixed that.  My car came with locking  lug nuts. Some dealers have a universal unlock but thats dangerous if you ever loose your unlock key!  I didnt know I even had this. A guy at costco couldnt get tires off. I think a dealer somewhere forgot to put it in during a rotation. I went to KIA dealers that couldnt even get them off. This locking lug nut is crazy. It would put you in a really bad situation for more easy than getting a tire stolen. I lost a good part of a whole day and I was within fairly close proximity of several Kia Dealers over this. So I had the locking lug nuts thrown out!  It cost time and many hours.  Id rather risk having a tire stolen as it would be easier than being stranded in timbuktu with no way to change a tire.  Your chances of a tire being stolen is far lower than your chances of unding up in a mess with those locking lugnuts on the tires.\""]},"execution_count":41,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vzeOAkWOHqAO","outputId":"663cf511-3d81-4ea0-adea-be2230b98b4f"},"source":["df[df['word_length']>=300].shape\n","#
